# Pulse-Core

This project contains a simple pulse simulation playground. Open `public/index.html` in a browser to try it out. Click cells to toggle them on or off, then press **Start** to watch the grid evolve using a flicker rule.

This scaffolding separates UI from simulation logic to allow future growth. Upcoming work will add pulse direction, folding geometry and substrate density.
